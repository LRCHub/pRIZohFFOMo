[00:09.05] I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
[00:17.84] This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
[00:45.84] 
[00:24.20] I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
[00:29.16] Somebody to have, somebody to hold
[00:33.47] It's easy to say, but it's never the same
[00:37.92] I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
[01:04.42] 
[00:41.88] Now the day bleeds into nightfall
[00:46.35] And you're not here to get me through it all
[00:50.31] I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
[00:55.03] I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[01:20.53] 
[01:01.31] I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
[01:09.87] This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
[01:40.37] 
[01:16.59] Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
[01:21.50] Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
[01:25.79] It's easy to say, but it's never the same
[01:30.22] I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
[01:55.22] 
[01:34.33] Now the day bleeds into nightfall
[01:38.68] And you're not here to get me through it all
[01:42.95] I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
[01:47.44] I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[02:12.94] 
[01:53.20] And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
[01:59.59] I fall into your arms
[02:03.62] I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
[02:28.62] 
[02:09.08] For now the day bleeds into nightfall
[02:13.65] And you're not here to get me through it all
[02:18.02] I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
[02:22.11] I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[02:47.61] 
[02:26.42] But now the day bleeds into nightfall
[02:31.09] And you're not here to get me through it all
[02:35.37] I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
[02:39.65] I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[03:05.15] 
[02:43.94] I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
[02:48.71] I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
